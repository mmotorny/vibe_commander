# Deviations of the portable C

The portable C is judged as the C translation was: by the scenarios, with
goldens recorded from the original, Volkov Commander 4.05. Where the
portable C is to behave otherwise than the original, that is a deviation,
and every deviation is declared here, before anything else says so:

- what the original does,
- what the portable C does,
- why,
- and which scenarios show it.

A scenario that a deviation changes gets a golden of its own, recorded from
the portable C and read by whoever records it. Such a golden is kept apart
from those of the original and says where it is from: it shows that nothing
has changed since it was recorded, not that anything is right.

A feature that only made sense on DOS is removed, not kept as a setting
that does nothing, and such a removal is declared here and made without
asking. Any other deviation, the fix of a bug of the original included, is
asked first. A bug of the original stays as it is until its fix has been
decided.

What the C translation, `src/c/`, already does otherwise than the original
is no deviation of this tree: it is in `harness/deviations.py`, and the
portable C began with it.

## The deviations

None yet. The portable C behaves as the C translation does.
