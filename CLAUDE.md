# Instructions for Claude

Standing instructions for working in this repository. Record new ones here,
not in Claude's memory: memory does not travel between computers.

## Third-party software

- Never commit anything proprietary. That includes the shareware Volkov
  Commander distribution and any commercial tool.
- That also covers anything reconstructed from the shareware binaries: no
  decompiled code, no disassembly, none of their strings. Where they hold
  material that the published source lacks, the source reserves room with
  the `ShwCode` and `ShwData` macros of `src/VCLAYOUT.INC`, which emit
  filler only. Recording where such material sits and how long it is, is
  fine; reproducing it is not.
- Only fetch and run software that has a clean licence: open-source
  software, or software obtained from its rights holder on terms that allow
  this use. The Volkov Commander shareware distribution qualifies, because
  it comes from its author's site under his shareware terms. Copies of
  commercial software from mirrors or abandonware sites do not, however
  useful; Borland's TASM and TLINK, which the original build uses, are the
  standing example.
- The same goes for their output. Do not use reference binaries, hashes or
  other results obtained by running such a tool on the side, and do not
  shape code to match them. The binaries Volkov shipped are a different
  matter: they are his own output, obtained from his site, and matching
  them byte for byte is the project's test of fidelity.
- Naming such tools is fine. Documentation should say plainly what the
  original was built with and where a reference came from; the restriction
  is on fetching and running them, not on mentioning them.
- Anything the work downloads is fetched at build or run time from its
  official source and pinned, by SHA-256 (see `harness/deps.py`) or by git
  commit (see `CMakeLists.txt`).

## Naming

- The project is called Vibe Commander. The name of the checkout directory
  or of the remote may be temporary; never write either into source,
  documentation or commit messages.

## Committing and pushing

- Show the result of a piece of work, then wait for confirmation before
  committing it.
- Once confirmed, commit and push together. A commit is never left unpushed.

## History

- The history is meant to be read: one deliberate, self-contained commit per
  step, described accurately. Get a commit right before it is pushed rather
  than fixing it afterwards.

## The original source

- The files in `src/` are CP866 text with CRLF line endings. Edit them as
  bytes; do not let an editor or tool re-encode them or change line endings.
  The same goes for `port/asm/`, which starts as a copy of them.
- The first commit holds the source exactly as its author published it, so
  `git diff` against that commit shows every change made since.

## The port

- The program is translated to C for DOS first, and compared with the
  original there. Nothing for other operating systems, and no layer to hide
  DOS behind, goes in until that translation is complete and verified.
- Fidelity means the same behaviour, bugs included. Port a bug as it is and
  report it; whether to fix it is decided separately.
- Translated code keeps the names that routines and data have in the
  assembly, until the whole program is C.
- Size matters, but need not be chased: twice the original is fine, ten
  times would be a red flag.
