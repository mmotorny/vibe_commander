# To do

Things that are known and not done. Standing instructions are in
`CLAUDE.md`; this is the list of loose ends.

## Known and not dealt with

- The number of bytes that the editor has free is not compared with the
  original's (see `harness/deviations.py`). The routine that works it out
  is still assembly. When it is translated, the number wants a check of
  its own: that it falls by one for every character typed, at least.
  It has been wrong once without a test saying so, when a stub that it
  calls handed back another CX. Held against the original by hand since,
  over eight steps in text and in hex: 9,712 less in each.
- Saving in the editor to a disk that cannot be written, the floppy A:
  of the bench, with the box of DOS's critical error, is in no scenario:
  it went beyond the stack of 256 bytes that the port had when the
  editor's saving was translated. With the stack of 4,096 bytes it can go
  back into one.
- `T80_00` takes what the program knows of the main extension file from
  the editor's text after saving it, and does so whether the file was
  written or not: a save of VC.EXT that fails changes what the program
  goes by until it is started again. Ported like that. Saving to the
  console writes nothing and is no error; and after a save under another
  name that fails, the new name is in the status line only once that is
  drawn again for another reason. Ported like that too.
- A disk that is full cannot be made on the bench, so what `T80_00` does
  then, deleting what it has written, rests on reading; and so does
  what it does when DOS refuses the attributes of a file just written.
- The harness can type Russian on the Russian bench, and nothing beyond
  ASCII on the other: Alt with the numeric keypad types nothing there.
- `tools/flagscan.py` follows flags until an instruction sets them all,
  and so reports a jump that reads a flag which an instruction in between
  has set: `DEC AX` and then `JE`, `STC` and then `JNC`. It should follow
  each flag by itself.

- The Info panel says how much memory is free: what the part of the
  program that stays during a command leaves, or with Memory allocation
  switched off, "F9 o m", what is left with all of the program loaded.
  Both follow the size of the port, and the number is left out of the
  comparison in every scenario (see `harness/deviations.py`). So nothing
  checks the number itself: that the port has less by what it is larger,
  at least. The same goes for what `mem` says in the scenario `command`,
  416K free under the original and 412K under the port, whose part that
  stays is 3,840 bytes longer by its stack. With those numbers left out,
  no scenario shows any more that the program gives up its memory while
  a command runs: a check of its own would hold the port's figure
  against the original's less what the link map says the part has grown
  by.
- Every disk of the bench has a volume label, so no scenario has the
  program look for one and find none. The Info does say "has no label"
  in `reread`, where it does not look: a directory named DIRINFO stops
  it before. The program asks whether to delete a label and does not
  get it off under FreeDOS: a disk without one would have to be made for
  the bench.
- `tools/routines.py` lists procedures only. Code that stands between
  two is not in its list; `harness/reach.py` knows it by its first
  label.
- What reading a directory does when a drive is not ready, when a list
  has more files than there is room for, or when a drive has no current
  directory to fall back on, runs in no scenario: the bench has no such
  drive, and a step makes one file. The same goes for the label of a
  drive of a network. They are listed as out of reach in
  `harness/ported.py` and rest on reading.
- `ReDir` reads byte 23 of the main data, a colour of the first palette,
  where it means the fourth character of a panel's path, to decide
  whether ".." gets the time and the attributes that DOS has for it. It
  is ported like that. The colour is never 0, so it always does.
- `GetVol` answers for a label that it has found with the carry flag
  set and in AX what DOS left in AH and the eleventh character of the
  label; `RdInfo` takes 53h there for a drive that is not ready. A
  label of eleven characters that ends in S would do that, if DOS
  leaves 0 in AH. Ported like that; not tried.
- Of the viewer, what looks at its keys is still assembly, the code of
  `VCVIEW.INC` between its procedures, and with it `V80_00`, which only
  calls `DialBox` for the search, and `F34_30` and `F34_40`, which read
  the extension files of the viewer and the editor.
- `PrevLin` has three instructions for a place that is not the start of
  a line and one for a line of the table that is not its own. No caller
  hands it either, so they ran in no scenario and are translated by
  reading; so is `V25_00` without a status line, which the viewer always
  has.
- Of `__U4D` in `port/asm/VC.ASM`, which divides 32-bit numbers for the
  compiled code, no scenario runs the half for a divisor of more than 16
  bits: nothing divides by one yet. It was held against a model of its
  steps, not run.

- Of the help, what it does for the mouse has run in no scenario, 105
  instructions of `Help`: a button held above the text or below it, a
  click and a second one on a line of the index, the middle button, a
  click outside the window. The bench has no mouse. It is translated by
  reading, and listed as out of reach in `harness/ported.py`.
- The help trusts its file. `DeCode` takes a length of 0 for 65536, so an
  entry whose text has no length would have the whole main data changed,
  byte by byte; an index without lines has Enter take the place of a page
  from its text; and a line whose end is missing is looked for
  through 65535 bytes. Ported like that. The file of the distribution
  has none of these, and what a scenario makes of it by typing a letter
  into it has pages that are refused for their length.

- Of the file search's command, `F67_00`, three instructions are listed
  as out of reach: two for a drive that the CD-ROM extensions answer
  for, and Go to where the directory cannot be changed to.
- Go to asks for the disk of the wrong drive. `F67_00` hands `ChgDisk`
  the address of the line, which is in the memory of the list, and
  `ChgDisk` reads at that offset in the main data: two bytes of the
  first palette, since a line begins within 16 bytes of its segment. So
  the current drive is asked about, unless the second byte is 3Ah, a
  colon, and then the "drive" of the first. Ported like that. Go to
  also copies 69 bytes of the line into the path of the panel, which
  has 68; the last goes into the place of the cursor, which is set
  next.
- "N files found." is put together from two texts of the assembly,
  each copied with the 15 bytes that begin with it: behind the full
  stop TmpBuf gets seven bytes of whatever follows `FnFl7_S` in the
  program. Nothing reads them; the C copies from the assembly, as long
  as that has them.
- What `FndMove` does for the mouse has run in no scenario, 96
  instructions: the middle button, a button held above the list or
  below it, a click outside the box, a click and a second one on a line.
  It is translated by reading, and so are the two places where
  `FindFil` runs out of memory, for its list and for the file it reads.
- `FndBack`, which takes the keys while a search runs, means to go back
  for the next key when the menu, "Stop, Go to, Quit", has taken one:
  Left, Right, Space, Backspace, a letter that is no answer. It tests
  the carry flag for that behind `MnMn40`, which draws the menu and ends
  in `Window`, and that leaves the carry clear. So it goes on to
  `FndMove` with what `MnMn40` left in AX, the colour of the chosen
  answer in both bytes, as if that were a key. `FndMove` knows no such
  key and does nothing, unless the colour is 0Dh or 1Bh, which it would
  take for Enter or Esc. On the bench the colour is 0Fh; the other
  palettes have not been looked at. Ported like that.
- A name to search for that has a full stop gets four bytes behind it
  that follow `\*.*` in the assembly: a zero and "VC.", the start of
  the name of the main extension file. Nothing reads the three; the C
  copies them from the assembly, `Mask_S`, as long as that has them.
- `FindFil` calls itself, through `DirFunc`, once for every level of
  the directories it searches. The original took 18 bytes of its stack
  of 256 for a level, by reading; what the port takes of its 4,096 has
  not been measured, and how deep a tree either can search has not been
  tried. The scenarios search three levels. DOS's critical error can come up with
  all of that on the stack: `FindFil` calls DOS for the files, and to
  open and read them.
- Of the dialogs, what they do for the mouse has run in no scenario, 255
  instructions: `Slct20` as a whole and parts of `Dialog`, `InpStr`,
  `Select`, `FlipFl` and `MnMn10`. They are translated by reading, and
  listed as out of reach in `harness/ported.py`.
- A dialog trusts its tables. One without a field takes no key and does
  not end, a box without a line has 65536, and a line to type into of
  length 0 is shown as one of 65536. Ported like that; the program has
  none of them.
- A click of the mouse into a line that is typed into puts the cursor
  where the mouse is, and no further than the text goes; `InpStr` looks
  for the end of the text in as many bytes as the line has, so in a
  line that is full it finds none and stops one short of the end. Ported
  like that, by reading.
- The routine that a dialog has for Enter and F10 got DX as `Dialog`
  happened to have it, the size of the box or of its buttons, and two of
  them, `M30_60` and `F38_10`, showed a box of their own with that as
  the text for ^I. From the C they get the offset of the dialog there,
  and those two, which are C as well, name no text. None of the lines of
  their boxes has ^I, so nothing read it.
- Of the box in which a directory is chosen from the tree, what it does
  for the mouse has run in no scenario, 93 instructions of `ChTree`: a
  button held on a line, above the lines or below them, a second click
  on a line, a click outside the box. It is translated by reading, and
  listed as out of reach in `harness/ported.py`. So are 17 instructions
  of `ReadTre`: for a drive that is not ready, at first or while its
  directories are read, for a tree of 767 entries, which has no room
  for another, and for hidden directories left out, which only a setup
  file made elsewhere asks for: `HidDirs` is in no menu.
- F2 and Ctrl+R in that box have `DelTr0` spoil the tree file so that
  the disk is read again, and `DelTr0` is told the drive by a path at
  ES:SI. `ChTree` leaves in SI what `Case` had there, the address behind
  the key's entry in its table of keys, in the code segment; in the main
  data that is in `TreeBuf`, in the name of the 510th entry of the
  tree. If the third character of that name were a colon, or for Ctrl+R
  the seventh, the file of the drive named before it would be spoiled
  instead of the current one's. DOS gives no name with a colon, so it
  takes a tree file made by hand. Ported like that: the C hands `DelTr0`
  the two addresses of the original, E45Ah and E45Eh.
- `ReadTre` takes a tree file for good if its two sums are right and its
  length is that of its number of directories, worked out in 16 bits: a
  file with the entries of ten directories that says 4106 passes, and
  the tree is then drawn from what lies behind `TreeBuf`. A file that
  says 0 or 4096 and has no entries has its sum taken over 65536 bytes,
  all of the main data's segment. Ported like that; it takes a file made
  by hand.
- `VCCOPY.INC` is C but for its boxes and texts, which `DialBox` and
  `Dialog` read in the assembly, and the stubs: of the commands, of what
  their dialogs call for the tree, and of `C00_00`, which `FncSel` and
  `FncMas` call. Those two, in `VCF1.INC`, are assembly still.
- What the commands of Copy and Rename do in the original and the port
  does after them; whether to mend any of it is not decided:
  - When a directory of a tree panel has been renamed, the current
    directory of DOS is taken along if its path begins with that of the
    directory, whether a name ends there or not: with DOCS renamed to X
    while DOCS2 is the current directory, the program goes to X2 if
    there is one, and stays where it is if there is not. In `copy-tree`.
  - Shift-F6, and F6 with the panels off or the Info active, offer the
    name of the file under the cursor or the last target according to
    BX and DX, which hold the numbers of selected files only where F5
    and F6 have counted them: there they are what the key left. The
    stub hands them on as they are. In `copy-ask`, where either way
    shows the same.
- A new name for a directory of the tree that makes its path longer
  than 64 characters is reported as "Can't create the directory", as a
  name with a path in it is. The first rests on reading: it takes a
  tree some ten levels deep.
- Copying and moving in C rest on reading where DOS would have to
  refuse what it has just allowed, or a drive not be ready: 32
  instructions, listed in `harness/ported.py`. So does going on with
  another disk when one is full, where the directories of the target
  are made on the new disk, 31 instructions: the same disk is still
  there on the bench.
- What the original does and the port does after it, found while
  `C00_00` was translated; whether to mend any of it is not decided:
  - F6 on a directory offers its own name, and Enter on that moves the
    directory into itself: `DOCS\DOCS` is made, then found in `DOCS`
    and moved into itself in turn, until the path is too long, with a
    box for every level and the directories left behind. In no
    scenario.
  - A directory that is moved and cannot be removed afterwards, because
    a file in it was skipped, is searched once to see whether it is
    empty. That search takes the place of the one that walks the
    directory above, which then goes on with the entries of the
    directory below as if they were its own: `SRC\PAPERS\README.TXT`
    is tried once more as `SRC\README.TXT`, and cannot be opened. In
    `copy-dirs`.
  - Renaming a file onto one that is there, with aPpend for an answer,
    says that it cannot open the file if that file has no attribute at
    all: the copying takes the attributes for the room that the name
    has left. In `move`. By the same way a file that DOS will not
    rename, for another reason than one in the way, is not copied
    instead if the target's path is the start of the source's: by
    reading.
  - When copying stops, by Esc, an error or a full disk, the target is
    deleted, also one that was being appended to and had been there
    before. Seen while `copy-full` was written; as it is now it has no
    such step.
  - A directory of the tree that DOS will not rename, the current one
    under FreeDOS, is made under the new name and its contents moved.
    The first entry is then given the new directory itself for a
    target: an empty directory in it is removed, as if moved, and a
    file cannot be renamed. The entries after it get the name of the
    old directory behind that of the new one, which is nowhere. In
    `move`.
  - A source that turns out to be the console, or whose attributes DOS
    will not tell, is left open, and so is a target that is the
    console: `copy` does both.
  - After a write that is short, on a disk that is full, the next one
    begins where a whole number of paragraphs ends: up to 15 bytes are
    written twice, and as many are missing where what was in the memory
    ends. That happens when a file is appended to one whose size is no
    whole number of clusters, the disk gets full, and the user goes on
    and has the target overwritten. `copy-full` did that at first: the
    port left a file of the same size and other contents, because where
    the memory ends depends on how much of it the program takes. It
    copies to new files now, so no scenario has it.
  - Of a device that gives its bytes in several calls of DOS to a
    piece, the room left in the memory is counted down by the last
    call only. By reading: the bench has no such device.
- The functions of `port/copy.c` are on the stack when DOS brings up
  its box for a critical error during a copy, a copy to the floppy A:
  for one. No scenario has that.
- `copy-full` fills C: by copies, 32 MB, in half a minute. So a full
  disk can be made on the bench after all, and what the editor does when
  it saves to one, listed as out of reach for `T80_00`, could be shown.
- The `port` test has five scenarios more for copying, 304 steps, which
  take two and a half minutes of machine time between them: `copy-full`
  alone 33 seconds on an idle machine and a minute next to the tests of
  other batches, the longest of all. It moves some 80 MB. Its first
  form did that in steps of up to 25 MB, and a step ran into the 20
  seconds that a step may take, twice, with other `port` tests and
  runs of goldens under way; no step moves more than 6 MB now. If the
  test is to be faster, this is the scenario to drop: 74 instructions
  of `C00_00` would go to the list of what is out of reach.
- When the editor has no room left for a line that has grown, `T51_00`
  beeps and takes what room there is, but moves what follows the line up
  by as much as it had asked for: the end of the text is lost, by what
  did not fit, and not the end of the line. Ported like that. The
  scenario `editor-full` fills the memory at the end of the text, where
  nothing follows and the line itself is cut; with text behind the line
  it rests on reading.
- Del at the end of what the editor keeps of a line longer than 3900
  characters joins the next line to those 3900 and drops the rest of the
  line. That is in what the editor does with a key, which is assembly
  still; `editor-long` and `editor-full` make their long lines that way.
- `T54_00`, which goes to the line before, looks backwards for where a
  line begins and then goes forwards again with `T53_00` until it is back
  where it came from, without asking whether `T53_00` found a line. If
  none were found before that place it would not end. That takes a text
  whose lines do not begin where going forwards has them, which hex mode
  might make; not tried. Ported like that.
- Three instructions of `T53_00` are listed as out of reach: in hex, for
  16 bytes that go beyond the end of their segment. The address it gets
  there has an offset below 16, or is a window of lines further on.
- What still goes by the time of the host, in the harness. The bench
  waits for a still screen when DOS has booted, before it saves the
  machine's state. A build that neither signals nor is the original is
  timed by still screens throughout, and the tools say so. For the port,
  Shift, Ctrl and Alt are held for 20 ms of the host, not until the
  program has seen them.
- A search can be given a key only where it begins: with the Enter
  that starts it, written as one name, or behind the help that such a
  key brings up. So `find` no longer has a key that stops a search
  between two parts of a file it reads, and the five instructions of
  `FindFil` that close the file then, `FnFl48`, are listed as out of
  reach. To have that again, the harness would have to put a key in
  when the search comes to a named place, in the original and in the
  port alike. That was tried for the original and worked, with the key
  written into the keyboard buffer of the BIOS at `FndBk1`; the same
  place was not found in the port, which would want a label of its own
  in the build that signals.
- The machine's own clock runs with the host's while the machine runs,
  however much of the processor the machine gets. What the program does
  by its timer, following the cursor to a directory after 0.6 s or
  telling a tap on Alt by three ticks, comes sooner in its work on a busy
  host. No golden has been seen to change by that. Put off: QEMU can run
  its clock by the instructions executed (`-icount`), so that the guest's
  time no longer follows the host's. To be considered if timing shows up
  as failures.
- `Machine.wait_for_prompt` takes a `>` before the cursor for the prompt
  of DOS. A command that leaves one there before it has finished would
  be taken for it; nothing runs after the program has ended in any
  scenario.
- `cmake --build build -j4` failed once in a new checkout, "The object is
  zero length" for one C file. Building without `-j` works.
- A run of the harness that is killed outright leaves its QEMU running,
  at full load.

- `^R` in a tree panel marks the tree's file as out of date and takes
  what `DelTr0` leaves in AL for the kind of the panel: 1, the one byte
  that DOS has written. With the file read-only the byte is not
  written, the routine beeps and leaves DOS's error there, 5: the panel
  is then one of a kind that there is not. The port hands back the same
  5. No scenario does it: what the C code of the panels makes of a
  fourth kind rests on reading, and whether it is what the original
  makes of it has not been tried. `delete` has `^R` with the file
  writable.
- A mask with a drive and no directory, "c:*.zzz" for Shift-F8, never
  says "Can't find files": `F38_70` calls DOS for an FCB with the carry
  flag set by a comparison before it, DOS leaves the flag, and `Intr21`
  takes it for an error. Ported like that, through `Intr21f`; `delete`
  has it. It rests on FreeDOS leaving the flag: of another DOS that
  clears it the original would say "Can't find files", and so would the
  port.
- When DOS deletes the files of a directory at one call, it stops at
  the first that is read-only; the others are deleted one by one
  afterwards. Cancel in the box about a directory that is not empty
  leaves that directory and goes on with the next one selected, where
  Cancel for a read-only file stops the command. `M30_50` does not ask
  whether DOS could read or set the date and the time of a file. All
  ported as they are.
- Of `VCF1.INC`, `FncSel`, which goes through the selected files of a
  panel, and `FncExt`, where a command ends that may have changed the
  disk, are still assembly, 267 bytes. They are code in the program's
  data, behind `DirFunc`, and `harness/coverage.py` cannot name them
  yet: no procedure follows them. Everything else of the file is C or
  a table. The commands that are C jump on to both, through `F1Next`.
- A command that is C returns where it goes on, and its stub jumps
  there: `F1Next` in `VCF1.INC`, with the `TO_` of `port/vc.h`. The
  commands of the other files can use the same; one that goes on
  somewhere else needs a number of its own there.
- F7 in a tree copies the path of the new directory into `CrnPath`
  from its third byte on, 66 bytes, and puts the zero behind them into
  the byte after `CrnPath`: the first of `ViewFil`, the name that
  Shift+F3, Shift+F4 and Shift+F8 offer again. Ported like that. And
  F7 with a name and no path adds the directory to the list of the
  current panel without asking whether that shows files, or has room.
- The volume label: the old one is deleted before the new one is made,
  so a label that cannot be made would leave none, on a DOS that
  deletes one. FreeDOS neither deletes the label nor shows the new
  one, and reports no error for either; what the program does where
  DOS does both rests on reading. Ported as it is.
- A drive that shares the floppy drive can be had on the bench after
  all: B:, typed. `delete-mask` has "Insert diskette for drive B:" and
  refuses, which is how `F38_70` came to stop there: its two
  instructions for that were listed as out of reach and are not any
  more. What copying lists as out of reach for "a disk the user will
  not put in" could be reached the same way, a path on B: and Esc;
  nobody has tried.
- What `F38_70` does when DOS says that a drive is not ready, or will
  not go back to the directory it came from, what `M30_50` does
  when DOS refuses the attributes of a file that it has just listed,
  `M30_60` where the year is written first, and `DirFunc` for a path
  of 68 characters or more ran in no scenario and rest on reading.
- A directory deleted with what is below it takes about 90 bytes of
  the stack for every level in the port, where the assembly took 22.
  The 32 levels that a path of DOS can have fit the port's stack; they
  did not fit the original's 256 bytes.

## What batches have lost time to

Minutes that a batch actually lost, for deciding which improvement of the
tools pays (see "A run of batches" in `CLAUDE.md`).

- The files of a panel and the place of the cursor, 17 routines, about
  half an hour in all:
  - 3 minutes: three tries at the one instruction of `NearFl` that runs
    when no file of the old list is left. What worked is emptying C:\ of
    its two directories.
  - 2 minutes: an offset taken from a C structure that the assembly has
    otherwise (`TreList`), found by the `tree` scenario; and a label
    inside a procedure that others call (`NumAd1`), found by the
    assembler. Both are in `CLAUDE.md` now.

- A panel of files on the screen, 9 routines, about half an hour in all:
  - 4 minutes: goldens derived twice for three scenarios, 70 seconds the
    second time. `harness/notice.py` needs the C, so it ran after the
    translation, and found three branches that no scenario noticed: a
    selected directory counted once its size is known, the mini status
    off, and the clock that leaves the path of the left panel alone, or
    that of the right one under the menu bar. Asking before translating,
    which scenario takes a branch either way, would have had the
    scenarios right the first time; the coverage of the original records
    instructions, not which way a jump went.
  - 2 minutes: the one instruction of `SetCur` that is out of reach. A
    try of twelve steps on an emptied disk, and then reading the five
    places that lead to it.
  - 1 minute: a step of 23 keys failed, "the key 0 did not arrive". One of
    16 keys is taken. Noted at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`.

- The tree and the Info in a panel, 8 routines, about 50 minutes in all:
  - 5 minutes: code that stands between procedures, `PutTre` and
    `PutInf`, could not be named to `harness/reach.py` or listed in
    `harness/ported.py`. Both take it by its first label now, a commit of
    its own.
  - 4 minutes: a key lost in the editor. The port test failed before
    anything was translated, an Enter gone from a step of seven keys: the
    editor empties the keyboard buffer after every key. Found by reading
    its loop; the scenario switches the option off first. Noted at the
    top of `harness/scenarios.py`.
  - 4 minutes: two steps that could not stay, each a golden derived, 23
    seconds, and one of them a port test failed, 34: the volume label,
    which the program does not get off the disk, and the memory free
    with Memory allocation off, which depends on the size of the program.
  - 4 minutes: three tries until a scenario noticed `FilePan` taking a
    panel that is switched off for one of files. Ins does not get there
    and the menu refuses by itself; what shows it is the Info drawn anew
    next to such a panel. Each try was a golden derived and a run of
    `harness/notice.py`, 55 seconds together.
  - 2 minutes: the Info was 12 bytes deeper in the stack in every
    scenario, written from inside the function that chooses between it
    and the tree. The stub chooses now.

- Reading what a panel shows, 5 routines, 38 minutes in all:
  - 9 minutes: the stack. As one function `ReDir` left 12 bytes of it in
    every scenario, and nothing said where it was deepest: the stack
    dumped from the machine could not be read, and a log of the
    registers from QEMU could. It is deepest in the filter
    of a panel, where DOS makes capital letters on the caller's stack.
  - 6 minutes: `harness/notice.py`, six runs of it, and two scenarios
    made longer for three branches that none had noticed, with their
    goldens derived again, 50 seconds. No error in the translation was
    found by it.
  - 2 minutes: two tries of steps that failed after 12 and 17 seconds,
    for a text with a space in it. Noted at the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py`.
  - 1 minute: a far pointer in `[bx dx]` had its halves the other way
    round, so no file was opened; three scenarios showed it. In
    `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 1 minute: `DrIn_F` went with `RdInfo` and the viewer uses it: found
    by the assembler.

- The viewer, 14 routines, 1,730 bytes, about 25 minutes in all, next
  to another batch in a checkout of its own:
  - 2 minutes: waiting for a turn at the computer, in three runs: 20
    seconds before a run of `harness/show.py`, 25 before the goldens
    were derived and 60 before the first `port` test. The rebase, the
    build and the test after it took a minute and met no conflict: the
    other batch was not on `main` yet.
  - 1 minute: a run of `harness/show.py` that pressed Enter on a file
    of A:\ instead of a directory and so ran `fdauto.bat`; the files
    there are not in the order of the bench's. Noted at the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py`.

- The editor: addresses in its text, a line on the screen, saving, 13
  routines, 1079 bytes, 40 minutes in all, next to the viewer's batch:
  - 5 minutes: a scenario that could not stay as written, found by the
    `port` test before anything was translated. It showed D:\VC in a
    panel, where the program's file has another name and size; and it
    saved to the write-protected floppy, which left 4 bytes of the stack
    in the port as it was. Two goldens derived again, 33 seconds each,
    and the stack of every step read from the machine by a script of ten
    lines around `scenarios._stack_left`: `ported.py` says how much a
    scenario leaves, not after which step.
  - 4 minutes: `T75_00` left CX as it came, where the original leaves
    0, and its caller goes on with CL. The test failed on a status line
    drawn once too often, 45 seconds; the caller was read again.
  - 3 minutes: two tries at a full disk, 31 and 52 seconds, before it
    showed that the floppy is write-protected. In `harness/scenarios.py`
    now.
  - 1 minute: an edit of `harness/scenarios.py` by a script cut off what
    follows the scenarios; put back from the commit before.
  - 1 minute waiting for a turn at the computer, in three runs.
  - 3 minutes for the rebase, with the viewer's batch on `main` first:
    six files in conflict, each where both batches had added to the end
    of the same list. Git cut the two lists of batches and of scenarios
    at lines they share, a closing bracket, so putting one side behind
    the other left both open; mended by hand. The build and the test
    after it took a minute and passed at once.

- The editor: the line buffer, from line to line and from word to word,
  9 routines, 1032 bytes, 30 minutes in all, next to three other batches:
  - 4 minutes: a step that the harness cannot record, Up in the editor
    where only the number of the line changes, to a lower one. Two runs
    of `harness/reach.py` that failed after 34 seconds each, and reading
    `wait_for_screen` for why. At the top of `harness/scenarios.py` now.
  - 2 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer: 60 seconds before a
    run of `harness/reach.py`, 15 before the goldens were derived, and
    the `port` test with the routines still assembly took 138 seconds
    next to the tests of the others, where it takes 99 by itself.
  - 4 minutes for getting onto `main`, twice: the larger stack arrived
    while the test after the first rebase ran. One conflict, in the notes
    at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`, where both had changed the same
    paragraph; a build and a test of 70 seconds each time. None of the
    other batches was on `main` yet.

- The help, 9 routines, 1,403 bytes, 36 minutes in all, next to three
  other batches. The translation passed the first time it was tested.
  - 5 minutes: planning the C and its stub around the 256 bytes of the
    stack, read from the callers and the routines below, before the
    stack was made larger. The test then failed on nothing but the
    stack, 6 bytes left with F1 in a dialog, and passed unchanged on
    the stack of 4,096 bytes; half a minute went on waiting for that
    to reach `main`.
  - 4 minutes and a half waiting for a turn at the computer before
    the rebases, in six runs: 57 and 26 seconds before two runs of `harness/reach.py`
    with steps, 97 before the goldens were derived, 46 and 19 before
    two `port` tests, and 25 before a derivation that then stopped at
    once, the scenarios not yet in the file: an edit had been refused
    and the refusal not read.
  - 1 minute: the C function named `Help_c`, which the assembler takes
    for `Help_C`. In `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 1 minute: the byte 1Ah at the end of the files of `port/asm/`,
    which a script that split them by lines did not expect. In
    `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 11 minutes for four rebases, the push refused once. The last was
    clean, and its test waited four minutes for a turn, behind a run
    that recorded the original. The second, on the larger stack, had
    one file in conflict, the notes at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`,
    where both sides had changed the end of the list. The third, on the
    editor's second batch, which reached `main` while the commit was
    being written, had six, each where both had added to the end of the
    same list; the list of batches was cut at its closing bracket again,
    and a script put the lines in between. Each time a build and a test,
    a minute and a half, which passed at once.

- Find file, 9 routines, 1,536 bytes, 42 minutes in all, next to three
  other batches. The translation passed the first time it was tested,
  but for the stack and for a stub that nothing called.
  - 8 minutes: finding out when a key reaches a search that runs, and
    what a step can rest on: three runs of `harness/reach.py` with
    steps, 17, 30 and 38 seconds, and reading `Input` and the harness
    for where the milliseconds go. A search by contents of the floppy
    stood still for longer than the original is waited for, so a step
    was recorded in the middle of it. At the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py` now.
  - 6 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer: 95 seconds before the
    third run of `harness/reach.py`, 50 and 40 before two derivations,
    and some three minutes of a `port` test that took 4:43 where it
    takes 1:16 by itself.
  - 1 minute and a half: a derivation that stopped, "the screen did not
    settle", at the step that ends in the help; the next one went
    through.
  - 1 minute: `FndAdr_c` not executed in the port. Its stub is called
    by Go to alone, which no scenario had: three steps more, and the
    golden derived again.
  - The `port` test failed on the stack alone, none of 256 bytes left
    in `stamps` and `find`, and passed on the stack of 4,096 bytes,
    which was on `main` by then.
  - 4 minutes for getting onto `main`, behind the larger stack, the
    editor's second batch and the help: three files in conflict, the
    lists of batches, of scenarios and of the C functions that the
    assembler is told of, the first two cut at their closing brackets
    again and put right by a script. Seven entries for C were there twice,
    made by the help's batch as well and under the same names, without
    a conflict; those of this batch went, and its C took the arguments
    and the answers of the others. A build and a test, 76 seconds,
    passed at once.

- The tree read from the disk and its box, 3 routines, 1,792 bytes,
  34 minutes in all, next to three other batches. The translation
  passed the first time it was tested, and nothing but waiting was lost.
  - 8 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer before the rebase, in
    four runs: 158 seconds before the goldens of the two scenarios were
    derived, which then took a minute, 143 and 134 before the two `port`
    tests, the one before translating and the one after, and 43 before a
    comparison of four scenarios. Two runs of `harness/reach.py` with
    steps, 20 and 36 seconds, did not wait.
  - 4 minutes for getting onto `main`, behind find file: two files in
    conflict, `README.md` and this one, each where both batches had
    written in the same place, and a script kept both. The lists of
    batches, of scenarios and of the C functions that the assembler is
    told of merged by themselves: this batch has its entries behind
    those of the tree in a panel, not at the end, and its entries for C
    next to its stubs. A build and a test, which waited 86 seconds for
    a turn and passed at once.

- Deleting, attributes and `DirFunc`, 8 routines, 1,607 bytes, 54
  minutes in all, next to three other batches:
  - 10 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer, in seven runs: 99
    seconds before a run of `harness/reach.py` with steps, 42, 157, 104
    and 77 before the goldens were derived, 27 before a `port` test and
    98 before a run of `harness/show.py` on the port. The others' tests
    follow one another, and a run that wants the computer alone waits
    for a gap.
  - 6 minutes: `EXTERN` for the C functions at the top of `VCF1.INC`,
    which is included inside the code. The assembler made near calls of
    the far ones without a word; deleting worked and the attributes
    ended in "Invalid Opcode". A `port` test failed, 77 seconds, three
    runs of `harness/show.py` on the port, and the bytes of a stub read
    in the program file. In `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 6 minutes: the golden of `delete` derived four times, 71 seconds
    each. The tree's file is gone from the root after a directory has
    been deleted from the tree; a panel lists the new one only when it
    is read again; and `DelTr0`, a label inside `DelTree` that `^R` in a
    tree calls, was found by the assembler when the scenario was done,
    and wanted a step. At the top of `harness/scenarios.py` now. Reading
    `tools/routines.py` for labels that others call, before the
    scenarios are written, would have saved the last one: it does not
    show them.
  - 4 minutes: `harness/reach.py` and the `port` test did not know
    `DirFunc`, which is code in the program's data. `harness/coverage.py`
    reads such procedures now, a commit of its own.
  - 1 minute: "F8 Enter" in one step leaves the box of F8 open, which
    takes no key typed ahead; half a try of 49 steps went another way
    than meant. Noted at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`.
  - 4 minutes for getting onto `main`, behind the tree and its box: two
    files in conflict, `README.md` and this one, where both batches had
    written in the same place. No conflict, and the same name twice:
    the tree's batch had made entries for `TstBrk` and `OncZoom` next
    to its stubs, and this one next to the routines; those next to the
    routines stay. It had also made an entry for `DelTr0`, which is C
    now: the entry went, and the tree's box calls the function. A build
    and a test of 146 seconds, which passed at once.

- The dialogs, 15 routines, 2,190 bytes, 50 minutes in all, next to
  three other batches. The translation passed the first time it was
  tested.
  - 8 minutes: an address that `harness/reach.py` listed, taken for
    another instruction. `Dialog` has `ADD BL,40` three times; the
    listing was searched for a label near the first of them, because
    `grep` takes the listing for a binary file and found nothing by the
    address: `grep -a`. The steps that reach the first did not reach the
    one listed, so the record of what ran looked wrong, and a trace of
    QEMU was kept and read to find that it was right. Three minutes of
    that were waiting for a turn.
  - 5 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer otherwise: 137 seconds
    before a run of `harness/reach.py` with 30 steps, 63 before the
    golden was derived, 100 before the `port` test with the routines
    still assembly; and the first test of the C took 156 seconds where
    it takes 78 by itself.
  - 3 minutes: "not executed in the port" for three functions that
    began by loading the segment of the assembly as `seg Title_S`, a
    number that is set when the program is loaded. A test of 139
    seconds, and an entry that hands the segment over instead. In
    `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 15 minutes for getting onto `main`, three times, each time behind
    what had arrived while the test before ran: the tree, deleting, and
    a change to the harness. Behind the tree one file was in conflict,
    `README.md`, and three things git did not show: the tree had made
    entries for `Input`, which this batch had made too, and for
    `InSt10`, which is C now and takes its arguments in another order,
    and `struct Box` was in its C file and in `port/vc.h`. Behind
    deleting eight files were in conflict, the lists of batches and of
    scenarios cut at their closing brackets again and put right by a
    script; its C file called `Dialog` by the entry that is gone, in
    seven places, and had `struct Box` too. The third was clean. A build
    and a test each time, 78, 142 and 75 seconds.

- Copying, renaming and moving, 9 routines, 3,018 bytes, 100 minutes in
  all, next to three other batches at a time, seven of which got onto
  `main` first:
  - 14 minutes: keys that did not arrive. 'F5 "readme.txt" Enter' as
    one step failed with "the key t did not arrive", in three runs of
    the original, 3 minutes of them, before a run of the port with the
    keyboard buffer printed at every key showed what it was: after a
    box with an error the dialog of F5 comes up slowly, and the keys
    behind F5 fill the buffer. It looked like one letter of one name,
    because the sixteenth key was a `t` each time. `reach.py`,
    `show.py` and `goldens.py` say which key and not which step, and
    print no screen of the steps before. Noted at the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py`.
  - 19 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer, in 43 runs, about
    half of them while other work went on: a derivation of goldens
    waited a minute or two each time, eight times, and the last `port`
    test took four minutes where it takes one and a half.
  - 12 minutes: goldens derived again. `move` three times, 2 minutes
    each with the waiting: once for steps added, once because a step of
    the editor in hex stopped with "the screen did not settle"; the
    file it was to make is now copied from the help file. `copy-full`
    four times, 2 or 3 minutes each: for a better ending; because that
    ending, going on after a full disk with a file that was appended
    to, left other contents in the port than in the original (see
    above), which the `port` test found after the rebase; and for
    smaller steps, after a `port` test of four minutes that stopped in
    it at the 20 seconds a step may take.
  - 1 minute: F6 and Enter on a directory, which moves it into itself.
  - 31 minutes from the first rebase to the push: four rebases, each
    with a build and a `port` test of two and a half to four minutes,
    and each but the last overtaken by another batch while its test
    ran. Six or seven files in conflict each time, `CLAUDE.md`,
    `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `ported.py`, `scenarios.py` and `VC.ASM`,
    wherever both sides had added at the same place: settled by a
    script that puts one side behind the other with the lines they
    share between them, a minute or two each time. What did not show
    as a conflict: `DirFunc_a`, `OncZoom_a` and `TstBrk_a` were there
    twice, made by other batches too, the same instruction for
    instruction; then `DirFunc`, `DelTree` and `Dialog` had become C,
    with other arguments, and the entries were gone. The C of this
    batch was changed to call what is there each time. Two of the
    tests failed: on the contents that `copy-full` left, and on its
    long step (see above).
  - What saved time: steps tried on the port's build that signals,
    which is the original's code until something is translated, needs
    no turn alone and takes a tenth of the time. A script of fifteen
    lines around `scenarios.run` and `show.print_screens` ran a whole
    scenario of `scenarios.py` that way; four scenarios of sixty steps
    were right when their goldens were first derived.

- What Copy and Rename ask first, the code of six commands and three
  routines, 903 bytes, 25 minutes to the commit, next to seven other
  batches. The translation passed the first time it was tested, and no
  run waited: nothing takes turns any more. Two goldens were derived in
  20 seconds, the first `port` test took 151 seconds.
  - 3 minutes: three drafts of the scenarios, tried on the port's build
    that signals, 10 seconds each. A step typed into the buttons of the
    dialog instead of its line, and after a directory of the tree is
    renamed the cursor is on another line. Both are at the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py` now.

- The commands of `VCF1.INC` and the file search's, 2,099 bytes of the
  original in five stretches and three small routines, next to seven
  other batches. The translation passed the first time it was tested,
  but for one number.
  - 6 minutes: `F37_00`, `F47_00` and `F38_00` could not be named to
    `harness/reach.py`: they stand in a stretch of code that begins in
    `VCMENU.INC`, with `M60_00`, and the tools took a stretch by its
    first label only. `harness/coverage.py` takes any label of one now,
    a commit of its own.
  - 2 minutes: the key bar of the box of the search, read from the
    wrong byte of the dialog's header, 32, which is its help page. Four
    scenarios showed it at once: 45 seconds, and the `STRUC` read
    again.
  - What saved time: all steps tried on the port's build that signals
    first, six runs of `harness/show.py --changes` of 5 to 15 seconds,
    before the goldens were derived, which then took 21 seconds for
    four scenarios and were right, but for Ctrl+F8, which was added.
    And `harness/compare.py` with only the scenarios of the batch, 20
    to 45 seconds, before the full test.

## Ideas put off

- Keeping the booted bench from one run of a tool to the next. Booting DOS
  for the two countries and making the bench's setup file take about five
  seconds of every run. What is kept would have to be thrown away whenever
  the harness, a download or QEMU changes.
- A file or a directory that a scenario makes gets the time of day, to
  the second, and the golden lists it; deriving is slower than testing, so
  the two differ. No scenario makes one yet. Such a time stamp could be
  recorded only as made during the run.
