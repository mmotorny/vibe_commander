# To do

Things that are known and not done. Standing instructions are in
`CLAUDE.md`; this is the list of loose ends.

## Known and not dealt with

- The number of bytes that the editor has free is not compared with the
  original's (see `harness/deviations.py`). The routine that works it out
  is still assembly. When it is translated, the number wants a check of
  its own: that it falls by one for every character typed, at least.
  It has been wrong once without a test saying so, when a stub that it
  calls handed back another CX. Held against the original by hand since,
  over eight steps in text and in hex: 9,712 less in each.
- Saving in the editor to a disk that cannot be written, the floppy A:
  of the bench, with the box of DOS's critical error, is in no scenario:
  it went beyond the stack of 256 bytes that the port had when the
  editor's saving was translated. With the stack of 4,096 bytes it can go
  back into one.
- `T80_00` takes what the program knows of the main extension file from
  the editor's text after saving it, and does so whether the file was
  written or not: a save of VC.EXT that fails changes what the program
  goes by until it is started again. Ported like that. Saving to the
  console writes nothing and is no error; and after a save under another
  name that fails, the new name is in the status line only once that is
  drawn again for another reason. Ported like that too.
- A disk that is full cannot be made on the bench, so what `T80_00` does
  then, deleting what it has written, rests on reading; and so does
  what it does when DOS refuses the attributes of a file just written.
- The harness can type Russian on the Russian bench, and nothing beyond
  ASCII on the other: Alt with the numeric keypad types nothing there.
- `tools/flagscan.py` follows flags until an instruction sets them all,
  and so reports a jump that reads a flag which an instruction in between
  has set: `DEC AX` and then `JE`, `STC` and then `JNC`. It should follow
  each flag by itself.

- The Info panel says how much memory is free: what the part of the
  program that stays during a command leaves, or with Memory allocation
  switched off, "F9 o m", what is left with all of the program loaded.
  Both follow the size of the port, and the number is left out of the
  comparison in every scenario (see `harness/deviations.py`). So nothing
  checks the number itself: that the port has less by what it is larger,
  at least. The same goes for what `mem` says in the scenario `command`,
  416K free under the original and 412K under the port, whose part that
  stays is 3,840 bytes longer by its stack. With those numbers left out,
  no scenario shows any more that the program gives up its memory while
  a command runs: a check of its own would hold the port's figure
  against the original's less what the link map says the part has grown
  by.
- Every disk of the bench has a volume label, so no scenario has the
  program look for one and find none. The Info does say "has no label"
  in `reread`, where it does not look: a directory named DIRINFO stops
  it before. The program asks whether to delete a label and does not
  get it off under FreeDOS: a disk without one would have to be made for
  the bench.
- `tools/routines.py` lists procedures only. Code that stands between
  two is not in its list; `harness/reach.py` knows it by its first
  label.
- What reading a directory does when a drive is not ready, when a list
  has more files than there is room for, or when a drive has no current
  directory to fall back on, runs in no scenario: the bench has no such
  drive, and a step makes one file. The same goes for the label of a
  drive of a network. They are listed as out of reach in
  `harness/ported.py` and rest on reading.
- `ReDir` reads byte 23 of the main data, a colour of the first palette,
  where it means the fourth character of a panel's path, to decide
  whether ".." gets the time and the attributes that DOS has for it. It
  is ported like that. The colour is never 0, so it always does.
- `GetVol` answers for a label that it has found with the carry flag
  set and in AX what DOS left in AH and the eleventh character of the
  label; `RdInfo` takes 53h there for a drive that is not ready. A
  label of eleven characters that ends in S would do that, if DOS
  leaves 0 in AH. Ported like that; not tried.
- Of the viewer, what looks at its keys is still assembly, the code of
  `VCVIEW.INC` between its procedures, and with it `V80_00`, which only
  calls `DialBox` for the search, and `F34_30` and `F34_40`, which read
  the extension files of the viewer and the editor.
- `PrevLin` has three instructions for a place that is not the start of
  a line and one for a line of the table that is not its own. No caller
  hands it either, so they ran in no scenario and are translated by
  reading; so is `V25_00` without a status line, which the viewer always
  has.
- Of `__U4D` in `port/asm/VC.ASM`, which divides 32-bit numbers for the
  compiled code, no scenario runs the half for a divisor of more than 16
  bits: nothing divides by one yet. It was held against a model of its
  steps, not run.

- Of the help, what it does for the mouse has run in no scenario, 105
  instructions of `Help`: a button held above the text or below it, a
  click and a second one on a line of the index, the middle button, a
  click outside the window. The bench has no mouse. It is translated by
  reading, and listed as out of reach in `harness/ported.py`.
- The help trusts its file. `DeCode` takes a length of 0 for 65536, so an
  entry whose text has no length would have the whole main data changed,
  byte by byte; an index without lines has Enter take the place of a page
  from its text; and a line whose end is missing is looked for
  through 65535 bytes. Ported like that. The file of the distribution
  has none of these, and what a scenario makes of it by typing a letter
  into it has pages that are refused for their length.

- `wait_for_screen` takes a change of one cell for blinking. In `columns`
  the editor closes its box after F2 and clears the `*` in its first row
  some 10 ms later; a sample between the two has the harness wait 20
  seconds for the `*` to come back, and the derivation stops with "the
  screen did not settle". That happened in 8 of 22 derivations of
  `columns` on an idle machine. It never made a wrong golden: derive
  again. The same makes a step impossible that changes four bytes of the
  screen or fewer and leaves less than there was, Up in the editor from
  line 4 to line 3: the harness waits for the screen before the key to
  come back, every time. Such a step is written to change more (see the
  top of `harness/scenarios.py`).
- When the editor has no room left for a line that has grown, `T51_00`
  beeps and takes what room there is, but moves what follows the line up
  by as much as it had asked for: the end of the text is lost, by what
  did not fit, and not the end of the line. Ported like that. The
  scenario `editor-full` fills the memory at the end of the text, where
  nothing follows and the line itself is cut; with text behind the line
  it rests on reading.
- Del at the end of what the editor keeps of a line longer than 3900
  characters joins the next line to those 3900 and drops the rest of the
  line. That is in what the editor does with a key, which is assembly
  still; `editor-long` and `editor-full` make their long lines that way.
- `T54_00`, which goes to the line before, looks backwards for where a
  line begins and then goes forwards again with `T53_00` until it is back
  where it came from, without asking whether `T53_00` found a line. If
  none were found before that place it would not end. That takes a text
  whose lines do not begin where going forwards has them, which hex mode
  might make; not tried. Ported like that.
- Three instructions of `T53_00` are listed as out of reach: in hex, for
  16 bytes that go beyond the end of their segment. The address it gets
  there has an offset below 16, or is a window of lines further on.
- What ran in the original is not the same every time. Three instructions
  of `Input0`, B16A to B16E, take a key that is already waiting when the
  program first asks, and `command.ran` came out with them once. The
  goldens of `quit`, `select` and `start` are without them too.
- `cmake --build build -j4` failed once in a new checkout, "The object is
  zero length" for one C file. Building without `-j` works.
- A run of the harness that is killed outright leaves its QEMU running,
  at full load and outside the turns of `harness/turn.py`.

## What batches have lost time to

Minutes that a batch actually lost, for deciding which improvement of the
tools pays (see "A run of batches" in `CLAUDE.md`).

- The files of a panel and the place of the cursor, 17 routines, about
  half an hour in all:
  - 3 minutes: three tries at the one instruction of `NearFl` that runs
    when no file of the old list is left. What worked is emptying C:\ of
    its two directories.
  - 2 minutes: an offset taken from a C structure that the assembly has
    otherwise (`TreList`), found by the `tree` scenario; and a label
    inside a procedure that others call (`NumAd1`), found by the
    assembler. Both are in `CLAUDE.md` now.

- A panel of files on the screen, 9 routines, about half an hour in all:
  - 4 minutes: goldens derived twice for three scenarios, 70 seconds the
    second time. `harness/notice.py` needs the C, so it ran after the
    translation, and found three branches that no scenario noticed: a
    selected directory counted once its size is known, the mini status
    off, and the clock that leaves the path of the left panel alone, or
    that of the right one under the menu bar. Asking before translating,
    which scenario takes a branch either way, would have had the
    scenarios right the first time; the coverage of the original records
    instructions, not which way a jump went.
  - 2 minutes: the one instruction of `SetCur` that is out of reach. A
    try of twelve steps on an emptied disk, and then reading the five
    places that lead to it.
  - 1 minute: a step of 23 keys failed, "the key 0 did not arrive". One of
    16 keys is taken. Noted at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`.

- The tree and the Info in a panel, 8 routines, about 50 minutes in all:
  - 5 minutes: code that stands between procedures, `PutTre` and
    `PutInf`, could not be named to `harness/reach.py` or listed in
    `harness/ported.py`. Both take it by its first label now, a commit of
    its own.
  - 4 minutes: a key lost in the editor. The port test failed before
    anything was translated, an Enter gone from a step of seven keys: the
    editor empties the keyboard buffer after every key. Found by reading
    its loop; the scenario switches the option off first. Noted at the
    top of `harness/scenarios.py`.
  - 4 minutes: two steps that could not stay, each a golden derived, 23
    seconds, and one of them a port test failed, 34: the volume label,
    which the program does not get off the disk, and the memory free
    with Memory allocation off, which depends on the size of the program.
  - 4 minutes: three tries until a scenario noticed `FilePan` taking a
    panel that is switched off for one of files. Ins does not get there
    and the menu refuses by itself; what shows it is the Info drawn anew
    next to such a panel. Each try was a golden derived and a run of
    `harness/notice.py`, 55 seconds together.
  - 2 minutes: the Info was 12 bytes deeper in the stack in every
    scenario, written from inside the function that chooses between it
    and the tree. The stub chooses now.

- Reading what a panel shows, 5 routines, 38 minutes in all:
  - 9 minutes: the stack. As one function `ReDir` left 12 bytes of it in
    every scenario, and nothing said where it was deepest: the stack
    dumped from the machine could not be read, and a log of the
    registers from QEMU could. It is deepest in the filter
    of a panel, where DOS makes capital letters on the caller's stack.
  - 6 minutes: `harness/notice.py`, six runs of it, and two scenarios
    made longer for three branches that none had noticed, with their
    goldens derived again, 50 seconds. No error in the translation was
    found by it.
  - 2 minutes: two tries of steps that failed after 12 and 17 seconds,
    for a text with a space in it. Noted at the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py`.
  - 1 minute: a far pointer in `[bx dx]` had its halves the other way
    round, so no file was opened; three scenarios showed it. In
    `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 1 minute: `DrIn_F` went with `RdInfo` and the viewer uses it: found
    by the assembler.

- The viewer, 14 routines, 1,730 bytes, about 25 minutes in all, next
  to another batch in a checkout of its own:
  - 2 minutes: waiting for a turn at the computer, in three runs: 20
    seconds before a run of `harness/show.py`, 25 before the goldens
    were derived and 60 before the first `port` test. The rebase, the
    build and the test after it took a minute and met no conflict: the
    other batch was not on `main` yet.
  - 1 minute: a run of `harness/show.py` that pressed Enter on a file
    of A:\ instead of a directory and so ran `fdauto.bat`; the files
    there are not in the order of the bench's. Noted at the top of
    `harness/scenarios.py`.

- The editor: addresses in its text, a line on the screen, saving, 13
  routines, 1079 bytes, 40 minutes in all, next to the viewer's batch:
  - 5 minutes: a scenario that could not stay as written, found by the
    `port` test before anything was translated. It showed D:\VC in a
    panel, where the program's file has another name and size; and it
    saved to the write-protected floppy, which left 4 bytes of the stack
    in the port as it was. Two goldens derived again, 33 seconds each,
    and the stack of every step read from the machine by a script of ten
    lines around `scenarios._stack_left`: `ported.py` says how much a
    scenario leaves, not after which step.
  - 4 minutes: `T75_00` left CX as it came, where the original leaves
    0, and its caller goes on with CL. The test failed on a status line
    drawn once too often, 45 seconds; the caller was read again.
  - 3 minutes: two tries at a full disk, 31 and 52 seconds, before it
    showed that the floppy is write-protected. In `harness/scenarios.py`
    now.
  - 1 minute: an edit of `harness/scenarios.py` by a script cut off what
    follows the scenarios; put back from the commit before.
  - 1 minute waiting for a turn at the computer, in three runs.
  - 3 minutes for the rebase, with the viewer's batch on `main` first:
    six files in conflict, each where both batches had added to the end
    of the same list. Git cut the two lists of batches and of scenarios
    at lines they share, a closing bracket, so putting one side behind
    the other left both open; mended by hand. The build and the test
    after it took a minute and passed at once.

- The editor: the line buffer, from line to line and from word to word,
  9 routines, 1032 bytes, 30 minutes in all, next to three other batches:
  - 4 minutes: a step that the harness cannot record, Up in the editor
    where only the number of the line changes, to a lower one. Two runs
    of `harness/reach.py` that failed after 34 seconds each, and reading
    `wait_for_screen` for why. At the top of `harness/scenarios.py` now.
  - 2 minutes waiting for a turn at the computer: 60 seconds before a
    run of `harness/reach.py`, 15 before the goldens were derived, and
    the `port` test with the routines still assembly took 138 seconds
    next to the tests of the others, where it takes 99 by itself.
  - 4 minutes for getting onto `main`, twice: the larger stack arrived
    while the test after the first rebase ran. One conflict, in the notes
    at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`, where both had changed the same
    paragraph; a build and a test of 70 seconds each time. None of the
    other batches was on `main` yet.

- The help, 9 routines, 1,403 bytes, 36 minutes in all, next to three
  other batches. The translation passed the first time it was tested.
  - 5 minutes: planning the C and its stub around the 256 bytes of the
    stack, read from the callers and the routines below, before the
    stack was made larger. The test then failed on nothing but the
    stack, 6 bytes left with F1 in a dialog, and passed unchanged on
    the stack of 4,096 bytes; half a minute went on waiting for that
    to reach `main`.
  - 4 minutes and a half waiting for a turn at the computer before
    the rebases, in six runs: 57 and 26 seconds before two runs of `harness/reach.py`
    with steps, 97 before the goldens were derived, 46 and 19 before
    two `port` tests, and 25 before a derivation that then stopped at
    once, the scenarios not yet in the file: an edit had been refused
    and the refusal not read.
  - 1 minute: the C function named `Help_c`, which the assembler takes
    for `Help_C`. In `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 1 minute: the byte 1Ah at the end of the files of `port/asm/`,
    which a script that split them by lines did not expect. In
    `CLAUDE.md` now.
  - 11 minutes for four rebases, the push refused once. The last was
    clean, and its test waited four minutes for a turn, behind a run
    that recorded the original. The second, on the larger stack, had
    one file in conflict, the notes at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`,
    where both sides had changed the end of the list. The third, on the
    editor's second batch, which reached `main` while the commit was
    being written, had six, each where both had added to the end of the
    same list; the list of batches was cut at its closing bracket again,
    and a script put the lines in between. Each time a build and a test,
    a minute and a half, which passed at once.

## Ideas put off

- Deriving goldens side by side, as the tests now run their scenarios. The
  original cannot say when it has finished a step, so the harness waits
  for the screen to stand still, and a machine slowed down by its
  neighbours may stand still before it has finished. Deriving all goldens
  takes two and a half minutes, and only a change to the bench asks for
  it.
- Keeping the booted bench from one run of a tool to the next. Booting DOS
  for the two countries and making the bench's setup file take about five
  seconds of every run. What is kept would have to be thrown away whenever
  the harness, a download or QEMU changes.
- A file or a directory that a scenario makes gets the time of day, to
  the second, and the golden lists it; deriving is slower than testing, so
  the two differ. No scenario makes one yet. Such a time stamp could be
  recorded only as made during the run.
