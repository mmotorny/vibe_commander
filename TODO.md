# To do

Things that are known and not done. Standing instructions are in
`CLAUDE.md`; this is the list of loose ends.

## Known and not dealt with

- The number of bytes that the editor has free is not compared with the
  original's (see `harness/deviations.py`). The routine that works it out
  is still assembly. When it is translated, the number wants a check of
  its own: that it falls by one for every character typed, at least.
- The harness can type Russian on the Russian bench, and nothing beyond
  ASCII on the other: Alt with the numeric keypad types nothing there.
- `tools/flagscan.py` follows flags until an instruction sets them all,
  and so reports a jump that reads a flag which an instruction in between
  has set: `DEC AX` and then `JE`, `STC` and then `JNC`. It should follow
  each flag by itself.

## What batches have lost time to

Minutes that a batch actually lost, for deciding which improvement of the
tools pays (see "A run of batches" in `CLAUDE.md`).

- The files of a panel and the place of the cursor, 17 routines, about
  half an hour in all:
  - 3 minutes: three tries at the one instruction of `NearFl` that runs
    when no file of the old list is left. What worked is emptying C:\ of
    its two directories.
  - 2 minutes: an offset taken from a C structure that the assembly has
    otherwise (`TreList`), found by the `tree` scenario; and a label
    inside a procedure that others call (`NumAd1`), found by the
    assembler. Both are in `CLAUDE.md` now.

- A panel of files on the screen, 9 routines, about half an hour in all:
  - 4 minutes: goldens derived twice for three scenarios, 70 seconds the
    second time. `harness/notice.py` needs the C, so it ran after the
    translation, and found three branches that no scenario noticed: a
    selected directory counted once its size is known, the mini status
    off, and the clock that leaves the path of the left panel alone, or
    that of the right one under the menu bar. Asking before translating,
    which scenario takes a branch either way, would have had the
    scenarios right the first time; the coverage of the original records
    instructions, not which way a jump went.
  - 2 minutes: the one instruction of `SetCur` that is out of reach. A
    try of twelve steps on an emptied disk, and then reading the five
    places that lead to it.
  - 1 minute: a step of 23 keys failed, "the key 0 did not arrive". One of
    16 keys is taken. Noted at the top of `harness/scenarios.py`.

## Ideas put off

- Deriving goldens side by side, as the tests now run their scenarios. The
  original cannot say when it has finished a step, so the harness waits
  for the screen to stand still, and a machine slowed down by its
  neighbours may stand still before it has finished. Deriving all goldens
  takes two and a half minutes, and only a change to the bench asks for
  it.
- Keeping the booted bench from one run of a tool to the next. Booting DOS
  for the two countries and making the bench's setup file take about five
  seconds of every run. What is kept would have to be thrown away whenever
  the harness, a download or QEMU changes.
- A file or a directory that a scenario makes gets the time of day, to
  the second, and the golden lists it; deriving is slower than testing, so
  the two differ. No scenario makes one yet. Such a time stamp could be
  recorded only as made during the run.
